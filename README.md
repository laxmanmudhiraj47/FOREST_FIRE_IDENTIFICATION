# FOREST_FIRE_IDENTIFICATION
This project detects forest fires from UAV videos using image processing. It applies motion detection to find moving regions, colour feature extraction to identify fire-like colours, and wavelet &amp; texture analysis to confirm fire presence. The system gives real-time results, showing whether fire is detected or not.
